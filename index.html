                A tsunami is a series of long waves generated by a large and sudden displacement of the ocean. Large earthquakes below or near the ocean floor are the most common cause, but landslides, volcanic activity, certain types of weather, and near earth objects (e.g., asteroids, comets) can also cause a tsunami.

            The map illustrates that almost all the locations were affected by tsunamis are located next to oceans especially pacific and indian oceans. moving now to the line chart, the number of tsunamis were oscillating through the period however there were extreme activity from the period 1994 to 1996. The stacked area chart depicts the different wave height based on the line chart range.            </p>

            Taking the period 2000 to 2017, to demonstrate an observation that not every large wave caused the largest lost in terms of lifes and houses. Even though, the largest wave is the one that coused the most number of deaths, we can see that was not the case with the wave that hit Haiti which resulted in over 3000 deaths while its height was slightly over 3 meters. Asia continent was the most affected by tsunamis in the given period. On the other hand, Europe was not recorded to be hit by tsunamis in the same period pf time.
